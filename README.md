# ucsd_thesis_template

These documents (.docx) are provided to serve as a template for formatting a thesis to be submitted at UC San Diego. This thesis was formatted following the [official guidelines provided by UCSD as of Fall 2018](https://grad.ucsd.edu/_files/academics/BlueBook%202017-18%20updated%204.13.18.pdf).

I hope this is useful, as the university only provides instructions but no templates.

If you want a LaTeX template, [here is a repo for that](https://github.com/ucsd-thesis/ucsd-thesis).

In the future when any of the guidelines change, please feel free to submit a pull request with the appropriate change, or give me a link to your repo/thesis that I can put in this README to let others know who may stumble onto this repo.
